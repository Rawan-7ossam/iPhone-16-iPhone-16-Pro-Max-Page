📸 MainSection Component

This component is a responsive hero section built with React + Framer Motion.
It displays a sequence of photographic-style images that smoothly transition and animate as the user scrolls.

🖼️ Images change based on screen size (XL, LG, MD, SM, XSM).

🎞️ Smooth clip-path animations reveal images one by one.

🔍 Last image shrinks and translates upward for a dynamic effect.

✨ A descriptive text fades in and slides up with scroll for a clean finish.
